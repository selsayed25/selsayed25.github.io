# Sami Elsayed's Website

This is the source code for my personal website. It is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), a modern static site generator.

It's currently under active development, so expect frequent updates and improvements.

## Setting Up Locally

To set up the project locally, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then, clone the repository and install the dependencies running `npm install` in the project root.

> Note: If you notice that after installing dependencies, there's vunerabilities reported by npm, running `npm audit fix` will resolve the issue.

Run the development server with `npm run dev`, and open your browser to `http://localhost:4321` to view the site locally.
