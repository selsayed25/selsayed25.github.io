        <h1>About me</h1>

        <h2>Early Childhood (2007-2016)</h2>

        <p>Born at the Fairfax INOVA Hospital in Falls Church, Virginia to two Sudanese parents on January 27, 2007. Sami E Elsayed has lived his entire life in Northern Virginia. He lived in Herndon during his first year, before moving to Reston in 2008. He lived in a poor neighborhood in Reston called Cedar Ridge, where most of people lived near the poverty line. From there, he attended Forest Edge Elementary during the 2009-2010 school year as a preschooler. He was a child of mental/physical issues, though his issues today seemed to wear off. Having undergone surgery in his left leg, he was wheelchaired for 1-2 years, before having it taken off in 2011. He undergone checks at the Reston Hospital in 2012. He had serious issues with English, having to learn English in two different classes, though he is exceptional in mathematics, history, and science. He took part of the Sudanese protests in 2013, which part of a revolution that is going across the Middle East (Arab Spring).</p>

        <h2>Big Moves, Big Changes (2016-2019)</h2>

        <p>Elsayed lived at Reston from 2008, before moving out on April 29, 2016. He moved to Chantilly and started to attend Lees Corner Elementary on May 3. Although he did do well in his English, he was still required to attend English sessions which kicked him out of the actual learning environment. Therefore, after a terrible spell for English, Elsayed decided to leave the program after the 2016-2017 school year, saying that it doesn't help him, nor help him succeed. This was a changing point for him, as he started 5th grade, he performed an amazing spell in mathematics, science, and English. This change made a huge increase in his SOL scores for English. His amazing performance just got better in 6th grade where his developed many skills and learnt like no other student. He won the President's Education Award Gold in June 2019. He also won 3 gold medals during his 3 years at Lees Corner.</p>

        <h2>The rocky road to TJHSST (2019-2021)</h2>

        <p>His big changes were really starting to take shape. His move to middle school had huge excitement from Elsayed, hoping that after middle school, he would be able to attend one of the most prestigious high schools in the nation, Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria. In middle school, he was very popular, being known as a person that learns fast, and solves thing quick, something that teachers usually point out. He also attended the annual National Geographic GeoBee, which he won in school, and moved to the states. However, his successful 7th grade year was halted in March 2020, when the Coronavirus pandemic arrived in Virginia.</p>

        <p>The drastic change in life was a huge hit at Elsayed. The pandemic eroded his skills that took years for him to master, including learning quickly. He ended 7th grade with a 4.00 GPA. 8th grade was one of the toughest years Elsayed has ever experience. The change to virtual learning is not a style that he is used to, so he had a hard hit during the first few weeks of 8th grade. He, however, did complete 1st quarter with all As, which qualifies him to apply to TJ. He was amazing in mathematics, as it taught him a skill on patience. However, Elsayed left the school year early on June 4 to Turkey and Sudan, thus ended his 2-year reign at Franklin. He got accepted to TJ on June 23 a few weeks later.</p>
